## Concept of XRMOD
MOD is both Modification. The concept is widely used in games and corresponds to modifiable video games. Famous games like Warcraft, Red Alert, Half-Life, CS, Victory Day and more!
We ported the MOD concept to the XRMOD Engine, giving users more freedom to create the creative interactive experience content they need! In this process, users do not need to worry about algorithm and code implementation, but only need to focus on the production of innovative interactive experience content. With just a small amount of code, you can use and create greater business value in applications that use XRMOD Engine.


The XRMOD engine can be a module or an unity plugin, depending on the environment you are using. 

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|Be Module|As the name implies, it will allow developers to embed XRMOD Engine into the App (with Unity).|
|Be Unity Plugin| XRMOD Engine provides full support for the Unity Editor, which can be used by creators not only for the creation of XR experience content, but also for plug-ins for Unity cross-platform applications.|
