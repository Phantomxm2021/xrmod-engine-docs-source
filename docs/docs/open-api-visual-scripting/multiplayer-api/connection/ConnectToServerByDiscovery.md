### Description

Suppose your are next to a friend. He starts a game in host mode and you want to join him. How will your phone locate his? Finding out his IP address is not exactly intuitive or something kids can do.

To solve this problem you can use Network Discovery. When your game starts, it sends a message in your current network asking "Is there any server available?". Any server within the same network will reply and provide information about how to connect to it.
