XR-MOD API is an indispensable code script interface in XR-MOD Engine. It allows us to write complex scripts to make our XR creative interactive content. Content developed by this API.

Scripts are an essential part of any XR experience you make in XR-MOD. Most XR experiences require scripts to respond to player input and schedule in-game events to happen when they should. Beyond that, scripts can be used to create graphical effects, control the physical behavior of objects, and even implement custom AI systems for characters in games.
