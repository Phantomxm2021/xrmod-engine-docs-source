## What's mean of MOD in the XRMOD

MOD is Modification or module. The concept is widely used in games and corresponds to modifiable video games. Famous games like Warcraft, Red Alert, Half-Life, CS, Victory Day and more!

We ported the MOD concept to the XRMOD Engine, giving users more freedom to create the creative interactive experience content they need! In this process, users do not need to worry about algorithm and code implementation, but only need to focus on the production of innovative interactive experience content. With only a small amount of code, you can use and create greater business value in applications that use XRMOD Engine.
