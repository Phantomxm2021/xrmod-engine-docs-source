## AR Algorithm
Used to configure the main algorithm of the AR experience; each AR experience must be configured with the main algorithm. Replace when the main algorithm fails to run. (Only supports startup, shutdown, and additional algorithms at runtime)

### Algorithm Auto Start
The main algorithm starts automatically, without the need for script calls.

### Focus Slam
Focused SLAM algorithm, the AR virtual body is placed on the position of the indicator.

### Plane Detection Mode
SLAM finds the plane algorithm, there are Horizontal, Vertical, and Both options.

### Anchor
The anchor point type SLAM algorithm rivets the AR virtual body on the anchor point.

### Gyro
Only the AR mode of the 3Dof algorithm is turned on, and the experiencer can only view it by rotating 360Â°, and there is no perception of spatial movement.

### Fixed
Sticker mode, which puts the AR virtual and thoughtful on the screen. Cannot have 6Dof perception.

### Image Tracking
Image tracking, which links the AR virtual body and Image together, and when the picture moves, the virtual body will also move with it.

### Max Moving Of Tracking
The maximum number of pictures that can be tracked in the AR experience.

### Immersal
Immersal  is a technology company focusing on AR cloud; it uses Immersal SDK to build centimeter-level, durable multi-user AR applications, which can be used on AR-enabled mobile devices and glasses.

- Plug-ins on iOS, Android and devices compatible with Huawei AR Engine
- Immersal Cloud Service's REST API for any device
- Pre-built applications are available on the App Store to map real-world locations
- It can even map indoor and outdoor large urban areas
- Very small map file format, extremely optimized
- Private/public map with sharing options
- Global map coordination supports WGS84 and ECEF
- Use GPS coordinates to mark and search the map
- Textured mesh of point cloud and available mapping space
- Support multiple maps at the same time in the same space
- Easy-to-use Unity example with templates for indoor navigation and more
- Detailed documentation helps developers get started
- Use the 3D map viewer to develop the portal
- Developer Token
- Developer Token obtained through Immersal Dashboard. Used to connect to Immersal server for authentication.

### Face Mesh
Face Mesh is a face geometry solution; it will construct a face mesh in real time, and generate an exclusive face model for the face.

:::danger
FaceMesh Visualizer will be create by yourself. And the Name  must be consistent with Your Project.Because ARMOD will - automatically load our facemesh visualizer.
