## Point Cloud Visualizer

With a custom point cloud visualizer, the AR device uses the device's camera and image analysis to track specific points in the world, and uses these points to build a map of its environment.
The point cloud is a set of feature points, which can change between each frame. Some platforms only generate one point cloud, while other platforms organize their feature points into different point clouds in different areas of space.
Point clouds are considered to be trackable, while individual feature points are not. However, feature points can be uniquely identified between frames because they have unique identifiers.
