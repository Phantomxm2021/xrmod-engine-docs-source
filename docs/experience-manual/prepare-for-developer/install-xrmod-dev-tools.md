# Install Dev-tools

In the previous chapter, we have installed Unity and created a Unity project. Next, we need to install the XRMOD development kit. Before the project starts, we need to install the XRMOD Kit using the `Unity Package Manager` .

## Add Registries

1. Open Unity Editor and create an URP project
2. Set the `Unity Package Manager` registries through `Edit`->`ProjectSetting`->`Package Manager`
4. Typing inthe form below in `Package Manager`->`Scoped Registries`, checked the `enable Preview Packages` and `Enable Pre-release Packages`, then click Apply to save your setings.

|Name|URL|Scope(s)|
|---|---|---|
|PhantomsXR|	https://registry.npmjs.org	|com.phantomsxr|

5. Open the `Unity Package Manager` via `Window` > `Package Manager` in the top menu bar
6. Switch the `registry` to `My Registries` again and you will see all development packages.
