This API is all the open interfaces provided by XMROD Engine for Android platform, allowing developers to better embed XRMOD into their applications.

The API is divided into two parts: the first part is the API for apps to call XRMOD Engine; the second part is all the event feedback (i.e. delegate, developers can build their own logic and performance in the corresponding callbacks) after XRMOD is launched.
